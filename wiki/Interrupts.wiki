When implementing timing, you`ll probably divide real cycles by 4. In this document, if not specified different, than the value is divided.

== Screen renderer ==
Modes cycle from 1 to 3, until screen renderer goes off the screen (indicated by LY register when it is equal to 144), then mode 0 is enabled. LY is still increased every 114 cycles. 

= Period Lengths =
|| *Mode* || *Divided* || *Real* ||
|| 0 *V-Blank* ||1140||4560||
|| 1 *OAM* ||19.25-20.75||77-83||
|| 2 *VRAM* ||42.25-43.75||169-175||
|| 3 *H-Blank* ||50.25-51.75||201-207||

114 ( thats 456 in real ) cycles needed to render one line. After H-Blank LY increases by 1, then loops to OAM again.
